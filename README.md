Useful plugins for protobuf, useful helper classes for protoc plugins, and modules for generating code imports.

## [protoc-gen-go-adapter](./cmd/protoc-gen-go-adapter/README.md) üöÄ

A plugin for generating adapter codes for adapting gRPC server as a gRPC client.

This is useful when a local singleton program has many services implementing the protobuf service and prefers to call each other directly in memory without marshalling and unmarshalling the message.

## [protoc-gen-go-enumx](./cmd/protoc-gen-go-enumx/README.md) üé®

A plugin for generating enum extension methods, works with `protoc-gen-go`.

## [protoc-gen-go-fieldmask](./cmd/protoc-gen-go-fieldmask/README.md) üõ†Ô∏è

A plugin for generating fieldmask paths helper for messages, works with `protoc-gen-go`.

It is a fork of [github.com/idodod/protoc-gen-fieldmask](https://github.com/idodod/protoc-gen-fieldmask) with some improvements.

## [protoc-gen-go-json](./cmd/protoc-gen-go-json/README.md) üì¶

A plugin for generating JSON marshalling and unmarshalling methods using protojson, works with `protoc-gen-go`.

It is a fork of [github.com/mitchellh/protoc-gen-go-json](https://github.com/mitchellh/protoc-gen-go-json) with some improvements.

## [protoc-gen-go-setter](./cmd/protoc-gen-go-setter/README.md) ‚ú®

A plugin for generating setter methods for protobuf messages.

It is useful for different messages to implement the same interface.

## [protoc-gen-ts-grpc-gateway-cli](./cmd/protoc-gen-ts-grpc-gateway-cli/README.md) üåê

A plugin for generating gRPC-Gateway client stubs for TypeScript.

It has full compatibility with [ts-proto](https://github.com/stephenh/ts-proto) and compatibility with [nice-grpc](https://github.com/deeplay-io/nice-grpc) client interfaces in most situations.

It can cover all the features that the [official gRPC-Gateway Client](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway-ts) can implement, and it can also cover more features defined in the official documentation.
